<b>coreXY direct drive extruder 3D printer running Smootieware firmware</b>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

<b>About:</b>
 
 What is working here?
 
 Hmmm... Everything? 
 
 This is not an another incomplete "work in progress" project.
 It's a work in progress project that has improvment in mind.
 
 I'm into 3dprinting for about 5 years, and active building 3d printers for at least 4 years.
 Learned a lot thanks to the community... and specially Prusa ;)
 Internet is a place were some got news, youtube, porn...
 and some having nerd stuff... software, mechanical, electrical and electronical articles, blogs, vlogs, faqs etc.
 If you are a tech Nerd just like me, you can find tons of very interesting educational articles that can build up your knowlage until...
 for me everything ended up here on GitHub.
 Why?
 because was living the 3dprinter hype and tested all the bullshit and non-bulshit projects on te planet.
 
 Now it's time to share some of the knowlage just like all those people all over the world shared with me.
 
 My goal is to gather some people that will/want to build, use and improve the project.
 I've spent about 3 months working on the Cad3D part (SolidWorks) of the project to make parts simple to print and simple to build.
 Most of those 3 months was a the path of math and symetry... and off course... aggressive wife :P
 Then had to spent some time working on Smoothieware firmware to suit the system.
 After that been studying how printer moves in slo-mo to further improve the config and mechanics.
 
 I wanted to print with parameters equal to Prusa i3 Mk3 and now got even beyond...

<b>Features:</b>
 
 * 32bit Smoothieware firmware for smooth motion
 * TMC2208 silent stepper drivers - spread cycle setup with step interpolarisation 1/256  
 * non-X-crossing belts - symetrical coreXY for hi-torque and stiffness
 * geared (3:1) direct drive extuder (simpler and more reliable printing then bowden)
 * hi-flow quality hotend (e3d hotend with volcano heat block) for high quality and fast printing
 * all axis with 2x higher mechanical resolution at same step rate (0.9deg 1/8 step = 1.8deg 1/16 step)
 * one motor doubble z-axis (no problems to sync motors because got just one for both bed side lifters)
 * all axis motors mounted at bottom of printer to lower the center of gravity 
 * 12V system max speed up to 220mm/s and acceleration at 3500mm/s2 
 * 24V system max speed up to 375mm/s and acceleration at 4500mm/s2
 * all of non-printed parts was selected to be worldwide availabe and have resonable price to quality ratio.

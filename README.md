 What is working here? 

 Hmmm... Everything? 

 This is not an another incomplete "work in progress" project. It's a work in progress project that has improvement in mind. 

 I'm into 3d printing for few years, and active building 3d printers for most of that time. Learned a lot thanks to the community... 
 and specially from community based systems like Prusa's. Internet is a place were some got news, youtube, porn... 
 and some having nerd stuff... software, mechanical, electrical and electronics articles, blogs, vlogs, faqs etc. 
 If you are a tech Nerd just like me, you can find tons of very interesting educational articles that can build up your knowledge until... 
 for me everything ended up here on GitHub. 
 
 Why? because was living the 3d printer hype and tested all the bullshit and non-bulshit projects on te planet. 

 Now it's time to share some of the knowledge just like all those people all over the world shared with me. 
 
 My goal is to gather some people that will/want to build, use and improve the project.
 I've spent over 3 months working on the Cad3D part (SolidWorks) of the project to make parts simple to print and simple for makers to assembly.
 The most of those 3 months was a the path of math, symetry, mechanics... and off course... aggressive wife :P
 Then had to spent some time working on some moddifications to Smoothieware firmware and hardware just to suit the system.
 After that been studying how printer moves in slo-mo to further improve the config and mechanics.
 After builiding & testing several machine variations, got to a place where the machine just after proper setup and calibration works without ANY failure within last several months.
 
 My main goal for the system was to print with speed and quality parameters equal or beyond the market systems at under 1000 euro price tag.

<b>Features:</b>

 * build plate 245 x 245 x 300 mm ( X x Y x Z )
 * automatic parts removal 
 * 32bit Smoothieware firmware for smooth motion
 * e3d volcano hotend with hartened steel 0.4mm nozzle
 * TMC2208 silent stepper drivers - spread cycle setup with step interpolarisation 1/256 
 * geared (3:1) direct drive extuder (simpler and more reliable printing then bowden)
 * max speed up to 375mm/s 
 * heated build plate with PET film surface for superb material adhesion 
 * support of multiple filament types (PLA, PET, TPU)
 * filament run-out sensor
 * non-X-crossing belts - symetrical coreXY for hi-torque and stiffness
 * hi-flow quality hotend (e3d hotend with volcano heat block) for high quality and fast printing
 * all axis with 2x higher mechanical resolution at same step rate (0.9deg 1/8 step = 1.8deg 1/16 step)
 * one motor doubble z-axis (no shaft sync problems)
 * all axis motors mounted at bottom of printer to lower the center of gravity  
 * all of non-printed parts was selected to be worldwide availabe and have resonable price to quality ratio.

<b>TODO:</b>

 * less budget print cooling system (fan replacment)
 
 * enclosure project with over-temperature controll
 
 * 3rd party controler boards support (actual controler price to high?)
 
 * automatic parts removal system test and firmware development for batch 3printing
 
 * <font color="green"><s>add latest 24V-hiwin-tmc2208 project files</s> <b>*done</b></font> 
 
 * cleanup in filenames / solidworks project
 
 * <font color="green"><s>cleanup in stl folder (right now it's pure project .stl dump, so lots of files not need to be printed)</s> <b>*done</b></font>
